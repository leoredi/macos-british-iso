# British ISO Keyboard Layout for macOS
British ISO keyboards files found many years ago on http://liyang.hu. The website seems down now so I have uploaded them here. Use them daily with my IBM Model M from 1988 and Snow Leopard and they are perfect. The `alt` version can be used as an alternative to the ISO version already available for modern macOS.

## How to
* Create the `/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/` directory if it does not exists.
* Copy all the files to it.
* Enjoy.
